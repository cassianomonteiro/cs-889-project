# Augmented reality to improve surrounding awareness of mobile phone users

This is a modified version of the game [FrozenBubble](https://github.com/videogameboy76/frozenbubbleandroid) to run an HCI experiment. We are researching the effect of the camera background on the user's awareness of its surroundings.

The description or our technique and experiment tasks can be seen on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLMNbknCOt4.

Experiment data, evaluation and full paper can be found in the [experiment](https://github.com/cassianomonteiro/cs-889-project/tree/master/experiment) folder.

Presentation slides with results: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zX1z0NL0qYRoMVOGXmmb7gtwOd6j_gIH9GSon7PzpPs/edit?usp=sharing.

DISCLAIMER: This research work HAS NOT BEEN PEER REVIEWED. This project was part of credit requirements for the CS-889 course at the University of Waterloo, Fall 2018.
