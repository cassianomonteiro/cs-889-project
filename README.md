# Experiment with the camera on the background of mobile phone tasks

This is a modified version of the game [FrozenBubble](https://github.com/videogameboy76/frozenbubbleandroid) to run an HCI experiment. We are researching the effect of the camera background on the user's awareness of its surroundings.

You can get the original game on the stores below.
